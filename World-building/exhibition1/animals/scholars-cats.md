# Scholar's Cats (Qitat al-Ulama)

## Physical Description
Scholar's Cats are medium-sized felines with distinctively large, luminous eyes adapted for reading in dim candlelight and lampflame. Their coats are typically deep midnight blue or silver-grey, marked with subtle patterns that scholars swear resemble geometric proofs or astronomical charts. Their paws are notably dexterous, capable of turning pages without tearing delicate manuscript paper.

## Cultural Significance
In the libraries and academies of the Scholar's Crescent, these cats are considered essential partners to serious scholars. They are believed to possess an intuitive understanding of organization and can somehow sense which texts belong together. Many cats are named after famous mathematicians or philosophers, and a scholar without a feline companion is considered either very junior or very unfortunate.

## Behavioral Traits
- **Manuscript Sensitivity**: Never damage books or papers, seem to understand their value
- **Pest Control**: Exceptionally skilled at eliminating mice and insects that threaten libraries
- **Study Companion**: Provide calm presence during long research sessions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Display unusual interest in geometric shapes and mathematical diagrams
- **Night Vision**: Excel at navigating dark libraries and scriptoriums

## Role in the Story
- **Library Guardians**: Protect precious manuscripts from rodents and environmental damage
- **Scholarly Status**: A cat's behavior can indicate a scholar's reputation and standing
- **Plot Elements**: Cats might lead characters to hidden texts or forgotten sections of libraries
- **Character Mirrors**: The relationship between scholar and cat reflects intellectual partnerships
- **Cultural Diplomacy**: Exchange of prized cats between institutions can cement academic alliances

## Intelligence and Training
While not formally trained, Scholar's Cats seem to absorb the intellectual atmosphere around them. They develop routines synchronized with their human partners—appearing for meals at precise times, knowing when to remain silent during important calculations, and somehow distinguishing between valuable manuscripts and common papers. Some cats have been observed sitting motionless for hours while their scholars work on complex proofs.

## Breeding and Selection
The most prized Scholar's Cats come from lines that have lived in academic settings for generations. Breeders, usually senior librarians or academy administrators, select for temperament, intelligence, and that indefinable quality that makes a cat a good intellectual companion. Kittens are often given to promising young scholars as graduation gifts.

## Interaction with Technology
Scholar's Cats have adapted remarkably well to the printing revolution. They seem to distinguish between handwritten manuscripts (which they treat with extreme care) and printed books (which they handle more casually). Some cats have learned to operate simple mechanical devices in libraries, such as opening specific drawers or activating reading lecterns.

## Academic Legends
Stories tell of cats who have saved important works by leading scholars away from fires, or who have somehow guided researchers to exactly the texts they needed for breakthrough discoveries. The most famous legend speaks of Al-Mirajat, a silver cat who supposedly lived for over a century in the Great Library of Madinat al-Ilm, witnessing the entire evolution of mathematical thought and carrying the memories of generations of scholars.

## Care and Feeding
Scholar's Cats are provided for by their academic institutions, with feeding schedules as regular as prayer times. They prefer simple, nutritious meals that don't interfere with their work schedules. Many develop strong preferences for specific reading environments—some prefer the astronomy towers, others the mathematical halls, and still others the literature sections.

## Mystical Attributes
While the Khwarizmi approach all phenomena scientifically, they acknowledge that Scholar's Cats display behaviors that border on the supernatural. Cats seem to sense when important discoveries are about to be made, becoming unusually active or attentive. Some scholars believe their cats can actually read, though this remains hotly debated in academic circles.
