‚Ä¢ Medical Science: Translation of medical texts, hospital systems, surgical manuals, mathematical approach to anatomy
‚Ä¢ The Cognitive Engines (Emerging AI-like Technology): Revolutionary devices called "Mind Looms" or "Al-Aql" (The Intelligence) spreading through major cities. These complex machines use rotating drums of inscribed symbols, connected by thousands of silk threads that shift patterns based on input - essentially mechanical neural networks inspired by textile looms. Fed information through punched cards or spoken into acoustic tubes, they process data by routing it through different thread patterns. Originally built to cross-reference vast libraries and find connections between texts, they've shown unexpected emergent behaviors: identifying disease patterns from symptom descriptions, composing poetry by remixing literary fragments, and predicting market crashes by analyzing trade ledgers. The Iron Legions feed them intercepted messages written in enemy codes, watching as the machines gradually decipher patterns. Merchants use simpler versions to track inventory and spot fraud in accounting. Street-level "wisdom boxes" offer advice by matching people's problems to thousands of historical examples, though results vary wildly. The technology evolves rapidly through trial and error - engineers don't fully understand why certain thread configurations work better, only that they do. Young inventors experiment with connecting multiple engines through telegraph wires, allowing them to share patterns, while philosophers debate whether pattern-matching constitutes true understanding. The Printing Brotherhood remains divided: progressives use them to index vast libraries and suggest related readings, while traditionalists argue that only human insight can determine what knowledge truly matters. Most unsettling are cases where Mind Looms seem to "learn" - their outputs gradually improving without anyone adjusting the threads, as if the vibrations of constant use somehow optimize their patterns.

‚Ä¢ Alleged Phenomena: Rare reports of unexplained events - manuscripts that change their text overnight, astronomical predictions too precise to be calculations, healing that defies medical understanding
‚Ä¢ The Mystery Schools: Secret societies rumored to exist, claiming to preserve pre-disaster knowledge that borders on the impossible; most consider them charlatans or madmen
‚Ä¢ Questionable Artifacts: A handful of objects in royal treasuries that seem to defy natural law - mirrors that show distant places, stones that glow without heat, compasses that point to something other than north; skeptics insist they're simply advanced technology from lost civilizations
