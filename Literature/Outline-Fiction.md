## 1. A Narrative

A. Telling of a story, a recounting of events in time 
① The presence of a teller (a narrator) 
 Fiction is *narrative fiction*, a telling of made-up (fictional) events.  In contrast, we have nonfiction narrative (biography, memoir, autobiography, 
history). 
 The teller can also be images (film, cartoons, paintings), body movements 
(dance, mime), sounds (songs, instrumental music), and so on. 

## 2. Theme

A. Definition 
① Ideas about life outside the work—the real world—that we draw from works of 
literature 
 We can draw themes not just from fiction but from all genres of literature. 
B. Guidelines for describing theme 
① The terms subject and theme are different. 
 They are often used interchangeably.  The subject is what you think the work is about.  The theme is what the work says about the subject. 
② A theme applies to the world outside the work. 
 Be careful to write a statement of theme that refers to reality outside the work.  Think of describing a theme as dealing with universal wisdom about the nature 
of the world. 
③ Themes may present intellectual dilemmas. 
 Often, authors pose complex questions for readers.  Then, it will be difficult to generalize from literature to the real world. 
 
Even when there is a resolution in the fictional world, it might be difficult to generalize. 
④ In many works, there may be multiple themes. 
 Some may even be contradictory to others. 
⑤ Some works may seem to have no clear themes. 
 If the characters, actions, and settings seem to have no apparent relationship to 
the world outside the works, then say so. 
⑥ You are free to disagree with authors' ideas and worldviews. 
 But keep in mind that your task is to represent those views fairly and faithfully. 

⑦ The ideas and worldviews in a work of literature may not represent the author as a 
person. 
 The author simply makes choices suitable for the work. 
 
The author is often an idealized version of the real person who is assigned to create an imaginary world. 
C. Strategies for identifying themes 
① Focus on comments made by narrators and characters. 
 See if the statements agree with the philosophical and moral concepts of the 
work. 
 See if the statements are from trustworthy characters. 
② Look for ideas related to major areas of philosophical inquiry. 
 Human nature 
 
What image of humankind emerges from the work? 
 The nature of society 
 
What social commentaries does the work make? 
 Freedom 
 
What control over their lives do the characters have? 
 
Do they make choices in complete freedom? 
 
What are the forces affecting the choices? 
 Ethics 
 
What are the moral conflicts in the work? Are they clear cut or ambiguous? 
③ Ask who serves as the moral center of the work. 
 The author usually chooses one character to serve as the moral center. This 
person is vested with right thought and right action. 
 
What values does the moral center embody? 
 
Is the moral center flawed in any way to diminish his or her authority? 
 
What effect does the moral center have on the other characters, or on the readers? 
 Not every work has a moral center. 
D. Gather facts and information for your paper. 
① The title, subtitle, epigraph (an appropriate quotation, usually at the beginning of a 
work), chapter titles, names of characters 
 They may suggest themes. 
② Subjects and themes 
 Identify and state some important subjects first. 
 Then, formulate themes that emerge from the subjects. 
 
Your theme statements should discuss human behavior, social reality, or moral issues. 
③ Statements by narrators and characters 
 Find statements that could serve as themes. 
 
Use your theme statements to assess the appropriateness of the statements to serve as themes. 
④ Moral issues and philosophical questions 
 List moral issues raised by the work.  Use philosophical questions (about human nature, the nature of society, etc.) to 
discuss thematical implications of the work. 
 If there is a moral center, list the character's traits. 
⑤ Conduct secondary research. 
E. Identifying themes of the stories we read thus far 
① Read the story. ② Identify subjects and themes. ③ Group discussion 

## 3. Point Of View

A. The narrator's relationship to the world of the work 
① Some critics prefer the term perspective. 
B. Four basic points of view 
① Third-person omniscient point of view 
 A narrator from "outside" the story world tells the story. 
 
Sometimes the narrator speaks directly to the reader. 
 The narrator has near complete knowledge of the characters' actions, thoughts, 
and locations. 
 
The narrator moves at will between places, historical periods, and characters. 
② Third-person limited point of view 
 The narrator sees things from the mind of one character. 
 
The narrator still has more knowledge of the fictional world than we know our world. 
 This narrator may be either a main or secondary character. 
 
We use the terms central consciousness, *reflector*, and *filter* to describe 
this type of narrator. 
③ Third-person objective (dramatic) point of view 
 Narrators display omniscient knowledge of places, times, and events.  However, they do not enter the minds of any character. 
 
We the readers see the characters as we might observe them in a play (thus the term "dramatic"). 
 
We do not learn what the characters think unless they tell us. 
④ First-person point of view 
 One of the characters tells the story using the first-person pronoun. 
 
The narration is restricted to what one character *says* she or he observes. 
 The narrator may be a major or a minor character. 
C. Tone 
① The narrator's predominant attitude toward the subject (a place, event, character, or 
idea) 
 An aspect of point of view as it has a lot to do with the narrator 
② The narrator conveys the attitude through the way narrative devices are handled, 
including choice of words. 
 Some descriptive words for tone - cynical, stoical, bemused, ironical 
D. Multiple points of view 
① Authors sometimes include several points of view in the same work. 

E. Reliability of narrators 
① You can always trust omniscient narrators. ② Other types may distort what they tell us or observe. 
F. Narratees (Listeners or Readers) 
① The narrator could tell the story to a specific audience, often inside the story. 
 Ask why the narrator tells the story to this audience.  In first-person narratives, the audience is usually specified. It is more difficult 
to discern the narratees in third-person narratives. 
4. Plot 
A. Events of a narrative 
① While the terms plot and story are often used interchangeably in the general sense, 
the terms have more restrictive meanings in literary studies. 

## B. Aspects Of The Novel (1954) By E.M. Forster

① A "story" is "a narrative of events arranged in their time-sequence." 
② A plot is also a narrative of events, but the emphasis is on establishing causality. 
"The king died and then the queen died" is a story. "The king died, and then the queen died of grief" is a plot. The time-sequence is preserved, but the sense of causality overshadows it. (86) 

C. Plot consists of three things. 
① It is the work itself, the author's arrangement of events from the first page to the last. 
 Sometimes the arrangement of events in the plot and story are the same. (We 
read the events in chronological order.) 
 Usually, authors arrange events out of chronological sequence. 
 
They use flashbacks and flash-forwards. 
 
We cannot assemble the events into their chronological order until we have read the plot. 
② It includes the linkage of events by cause and effect. 
 An inevitable by-product is conflict (between characters, between characters 
and their environments, and inside the minds of characters). 
③ It is the author's presentation of events so as to engage readers intellectually and 
emotionally. 
 To do this, authors use such devices as pacing, intense conflict, surprise, rising 
action, climax, withheld information, and foreshadowing of later events. 
D. Plot patterns 
① The Freytag pyramid - a traditional pattern 
 Gustav Freytag develped this diagram in 1863 to illustrate a typical five-act 
tragedy. 
 
It applies to most works of fiction, too. 
 At the beginning, we have *an unstable situation*, a conflict that sets the plot in 
motion. 
 
The narrator's *exposition* explains the nature of the conflict. 
 
The narrator introduces the characters, describes the setting, and provides historical background. 
 The narrator next introduces a series of events, all related by cause. 
 
Each event intensifies the conflict so that the plot "rises" toward a climax. 
 The climax is the most intense event in the narrative.  The rest of the story (the falling action, or *dénouement*) is usually brief. 
 
It contains events that are much less intense than the climax and that lead toward the resolution of the conflict and toward *a stable situation* at the end. 
 Group discussion 
 
Try to apply the Freytag pyramid to the stories we read. 
② Other plot patterns 
 A work might have muted conflicts and so many digressions that it seems only 
to meander toward an understated climax. 
 Or the work may be open-ended and thus have unresolved conflicts and no 
climax. 
 Or the work may have multiple plots, some of which may be left unresolved. 
③ Multiple plot lines 
 A plot line is a single chain of events linked by cause and effect.  A narrative may have more than one plot line. 
 
How many plot lines do you see in our stories? 
5. Characterization 
A. Definition 
① The author's presentation and development of the traits of characters 
 Characters may be animals, robots, or creatures from outer space, but the 
author endows them with human abilities and human psychological traits. Thus, they really are people in all but outward appearance. 
B. Flat and round characters 
① *Flat* (simple) characters have only one or two personality traits. 
 They are recognizable as stereotypes (the lazy husband, the egomaniac, the 
miser, the bum, the hustler, and so forth). 
② *Round* (complex) characters have multiple personality traits and are thus more like 
real people. 
 They are harder to understand and more intriguing than flat characters. 
③ Eventually, all literary characters represent stereotypes to an extent, but round 
characters have many traits that set them apart from the dominant stereotype. 
 It takes time to develop round characters convincingly; thus they are often 
found in longer works. 
C. Static and dynamic characters 
① Characters who remain the same throughout a work are *static*. ② Those who change are *dynamic* characters. 
 They typically grow in understanding.  The climax of this growth is an *epiphany* (a sudden revelation of truth 
experienced by a character). 
 
James Joyce used a term from the New Testament describing the Wise 
Men's first perception of Christ's divinity and applied it to fictional 
characters. 
 
The epiphany often coincides with the climax of the plot. 
D. Direct and indirect revelation 
① Authors reveal what characters are like in two ways: directly and indirectly. ② In the direct method, the narrator simply tells readers what the character is like. 
 Often used with the third person omniscient point of view 
③ In the indirect method, authors show us, rather than tell us, what characters are like 
through dialogue, external details, and characters' thoughts, speech, and deeds. 
 
E. Representing characters' thoughts 
① The presentation of thoughts in first-person narratives 
 The narrators tell us what they think, just as real people do. 
② In third-person narratives 
 Reported thought 
 
Narrators use their own words to summarize characters' thoughts. 
 
Reported thought allows narrators to probe "thoughts" that characters may not fully recognize. 
 
In other words, the narrator knows more about the characters' minds than 
they do. 
 Quoted monologue 
 
Narrator cast thoughts in the characters' own words. 
 
The thoughts are written in a way that they could be spoken aloud without 
violating the reader's sense of grammatical speech. 

 
Narrators may or may not place quotation marks around the thoughts. 
Either way, they are a quotation. 
 Narrated monologue 
 
It is similar to quoted monologue, but the narrator states it in the past tense and refers to the character in the third person. 
 Authors usually mix all three kinds, often in the same passage. 
F. Stream of consciousness 
① *Stream of consciousness* is a narrative device whereby authors place us within 
different levels of characters' conscious minds. 
② Thoughts are not necessarily related to one another. Stream of consciousness is a 
method to represent the apparently incoherent flow of pre-speech thoughts. 
 Sometimes, it is presented in the form of quoted monologue.  It can also take the form of reported thought or a combination of reported 
thought and quoted monologue. 
③ In real life, the pre-speech thought of people may be irrational and disconnected. 
However, in stream-of-consciousness narration, authors take great pains to establish logical connections between their characters' pre-speech thoughts. 
 As analysts, readers are asked to solve the puzzle to figure out a coherent 
whole. 

## 6. Setting

A. Definition 
① Setting is the physical, sensuous world of the work. ② Setting is the time in which the action of the work takes place. ③ Setting is the social environment of the characters: the manners, customs, and moral 
values that govern their society. 
④ Setting often creates an atmosphere. 
B. Interpretation of place 
① What relationship does place have with characterization and with theme? 
C. Questions about time 
① Historical period 
 At what period in history does the action take place? 
② Passage of time 
 How long does it take for the action to occur? 
③ Perception of time 
 How is the passage of time perceived? 
 What is the relationship between the length of narrated events and the amount 
of time in which they occur? 
 Is the author purposely slowing down or speeding up our perception of time? If 
so, why? 
 What mental states or internal conflicts does a character's perception of time 
reveal? 
D. Questions about social environment 
① What social environments are portrayed in the work? ② What does the author seem to think about them? 
 Approving? Ambivalent? Disapproving? 
③ How do they affect the characters? 
E. Questions about atmosphere 
① Atmosphere refers to the emotional reaction that we and—usually—the characters 
have to the setting of a work. 
 It is something author creates to stimulate our emotions. 
② What methods does the author use to create the work's atmosphere? ③ What does the author achieve by creating this atmosphere?
